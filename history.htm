                <p class="aa">n October 1886, Scotsman David Danskin and his fellow 15 munitions workers in Woolwich,
                    now South East
                    London, formed Arsenal as Dial Square, with each member contributing sixpence and Danskin adding
                    another
                    three shillings to help form the club. Named after the heart of the Royal Arsenal complex, they took
                    the
                    name of the whole complex a month later. Royal Arsenal F.C.'s first home was Plumstead Common,
                    though
                    they spent most of their time in South East London playing on the other side of Plumstead, at the
                    Manor
                    Ground. Royal Arsenal won Arsenal's first trophies in 1890 and 1891, and these were the only
                    football
                    association trophies Arsenal won during their time in South East London. In 1891, Royal Arsenal
                    became
                    the first London club to turn professiona</p>

                <p class="aa">Royal Arsenal renamed themselves for a second time upon becoming a limited
                    liability company in 1893. They registered their new name, Woolwich Arsenal, with The Football
                    League when the club ascended later that year. Woolwich Arsenal was the first southern member of
                    The Football League, starting out in the Second Division and winning promotion to the First Division
                    in 1904. Falling attendances, due to financial difficulties among the munitions workers and the
                    arrival
                    of more accessible football clubs elsewhere in the city, led the club close to bankruptcy by
                    1910.Businessmen Henry Norris and William Hall became involved in the club, and sought to move them
                    e
                    lsewhere.In 1913, soon after relegation back to the Second Division, Woolwich Arsenal moved to the
                    new
                    Arsenal Stadium in Highbury</p>

                <p class="aa">With a new home and First Division football, attendances were more than double those at
                    the Manor Ground, and Arsenal's budget grew rapidly. Their location and record-breaking salary offer
                    lured star Huddersfield Town manager Herbert Chapman in 1925. Over the next five years, Chapman
                    built a new Arsenal. He appointed enduring new trainer Tom Whittaker,[33] implemented Charlie
                    Buchan's new twist on the nascent WM formation, captured young players like Cliff Bastin and Eddie
                    Hapgood, and lavished Highbury's income on stars like David Jack and Alex James. With
                    record-breaking spending and gate receipts, Arsenal quickly became known as the Bank of England clu

                    <p class="aa">Transformed, Chapman's Arsenal claimed their first national trophy, the FA Cup, in
                        1930. Two League Championships followed, in 1930–31 and 1932–33. Chapman also presided over
                        multiple off the pitch changes: white sleeves and shirt numbers were added to the kit; a Tube
                        station was named after the club;[42][43] and the first of two opulent, Art Deco stands was
                        completed, with some of the first floodlights in English football. Suddenly, in the middle of
                        the 1933–34 season, Chapman died of pneumonia. His work was left to Joe Shaw and George Allison,
                        who saw out a hat-trick with the 1933–34 and 1934–35 titles, and then won the 1936 FA Cup and
                        1937–38 title World War II meant The Football League was suspended for seven years, but Arsenal
                        returned to win it in the second post-war season, 1947–48. This was Tom Whittaker's first season
                        as manager, after his promotion to succeed Allison, and the club had equalled the champions of
                        England record. They won a third FA Cup in 1950, and then won a record-breaking seventh
                        championship in 1952–53</p>

                    <p class="aa">One of Bertie Mee's double winners, George Graham, returned as manager in 1986.
                        Arsenal won their first League Cup in 1987, Graham's first season in charge. By 1988, new
                        signings Nigel Winterburn, Lee Dixon and Steve Bould had joined the club to complete the "famous
                        Back Four" led by existing player Tony Adams. They immediately won the 1988 Football League
                        Centenary Trophy, and followed it with the 1988–89 Football League title, snatched with a
                        last-minute goal in the final game of the season against fellow title challengers Liverpool.
                        Graham's Arsenal won another title in 1990–91, losing only one match, won the FA Cup and League
                        Cup double in 1993, and the European Cup Winners' Cup, in 1994. Graham's reputation was
                        tarnished when he was found to have taken kickbacks from agent Rune Hauge for signing certain
                        players,s and he was dismissed in 1995. His permanent replacement, Bruce Rioch, lasted for only
                        one season, leaving the club after a dispute with the board of directors.</p>

                    <p class="aa">Arsenal's large fanbase often refer to themselves as "Gooners", the name derived from
                        the team's nickname, "The Gunners". Virtually all home matches sell out; in 2007–08 Arsenal had
                        the second-highest average League attendance for an English club (60,070, which was 99.5% of
                        available capacity), and, as of 2015, the third-highest all-time average attendance. Arsenal
                        have the seventh highest average attendance of European football clubs only behind Borussia
                        Dortmund, FC Barcelona, Manchester United, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, and Schalke. The club's
                        location, adjoining wealthy areas such as Canonbury and Barnsbury, mixed areas such as
                        Islington, Holloway, Highbury, and the adjacent London Borough of Camden, and largely
                        working-class areas such as Finsbury Park and Stoke Newington, has meant that Arsenal's
                        supporters have come from a variety of social classes. Much of the Afro-Caribbean support comes
                        from the neighbouring London Borough of Hackney and a large portion of the South Asian Arsenal
                        supporters commute to the stadium from Wembley Park, North West of the capital. There was also
                        traditionally a large Irish community that followed Arsenal, with the nearby Archway area having
                        a particularly large community, but Irish migration to North London is much lower than in the
                        1960s or 1970s.</p>
